India’s Chandrayaan missions have been a giant leap in lunar exploration, proving that the Moon isn’t just a boring rock but full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered. Chandrayaan-1 confirmed water molecules on the Moon, while Chandrayaan-2 attempted a soft landing but had a "slight" miscalculation—like missing a parking spot by a few kilometers. However, Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed near the Moon’s south pole, making India the first country to achieve this milestone, proving that persistence (and solid engineering) always pays off.
