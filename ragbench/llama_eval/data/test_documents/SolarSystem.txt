The Solar System is our cosmic neighborhood, with the Sun at its center, keeping everything in check like a strict teacher. It consists of eight planets, several moons, asteroids, and comets, all moving in a well-organized chaosâ€”except Pluto, which was demoted to a dwarf planet and is still emotionally recovering. Earth is the only planet known to support life, while others like Jupiter and Saturn prefer showing off with their massive size and fancy rings.
